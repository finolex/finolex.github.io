		<h1>Story</h1>
		<div>
			<p>I like to consider myself as a Jack of all trades.</p>

			<p>I take pride in being courageous and taking risks to start new ventures and to learn new things every day. I find this constantly keeps me stimulated and excited, and I don’t feel burdened by any learning curves.</p>

			<p> As a child, my interest for digital media began when I was first introduced to animating. With just the slightest twitch of the mouse, I could control the emotions of my audience through my fingertips. Soon, I learned that my passion laid in storytelling and understanding my audience in order to deliver content that serves best of their time. I then began to divulge into film.</p>

			<p>Picking up Photoshop, Lightroom and Illustrator followed shortly after. While it is more recently that I’ve stepped foot into the graphic design world of producing art, I was always fascinated by production of movies, music and art itself.</p>

			<p>As an analog to my passion in digital media, almost an alter ego, I have always felt the altruistic need to add value to the lives of others. While the tech industry has experienced ineffable growth over the part couple of decades, the orthodox mindset that addresses healthcare boggles it down to remain inefficient, inaccessible, expensive, cumbersome and to some, frightening.</p>

			<p>I became directly involved in the prototyping of the devices, as well understanding the role of entrepreneurship in society. I learned that businesses, when run well, have the potential to touch many lives, provide jobs, create value, and remain sustainable by adapting to the changing needs of their users.</p>

			<p>I learned that I could combine all my strengths and work on creating a system that might one day evolve into a service that reminds anyone who is afraid or alone when feeling ill that they have resources that they can reach out to without having to fork out a fortune. Albeit in a very early developmental/seed stage, I have begun working on a healthcare venture to hopefully solve the quandaries of healthcare (more information can be found <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/engagehealthcare" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

			<p>So here I stand now, in my Junior Year at NYU at 21. I have come a far way from the little boy furiously clicking away at his Macromedia Flash application in an attempt to make his sprites fly across the screen in front of flashy effects.</p>

			<p>But I know I have a long way to go before I can be satiated with what I have achieved.  I will continue to fight for what I believe is important to me, because it is the only way I know how to move forward.</p>
